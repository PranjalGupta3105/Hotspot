Hye,
This is a Cousin of My Brother Connectify.
It uses Java's File Handling Application Domain to build batch files and script them with the commands runnable on the Command prompt. The 
Program takes the Hotspot's Name from the user as well the preferred password. "Caution: The Password length must not be less then the 8 Characters".

Once the batch files created by the Java Program are executed on Command Prompt as "Administrator" the internal hotspot with the specified name 
is created and the user could see the Hotspot named as specified.

Next if you wish to share the Internet follow the steps:
1. Right Click the "Open Network and Sharing Center" from the network icon on your machine
2. Go to the "Change Adapter Settings" (Top Left Corner")
3. Select the network option whose network you would like to share and Right Click and Go to "Properties" Button.
4. Select the "Sharing" Tab.
5.Check the checkbox that says "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet Connection".
6.Also, check mark the checkbox that says "Allow other network users to control or disable the shared Internet Connection".
6.Also, Check mark all of the "Advance Settings" from the "Settings.." Button on right side of this windows.
7. Click Ok and return back.
Your Shareable Internet is Ready.....
